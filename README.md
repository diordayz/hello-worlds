# hello-worlds
ideas, resources, etc.
Hi I am a son, significant other, friend, explorer, space enthusiasit, learner, first time aliver.
I want to learn different languages of code to assist me in following my dreams, whatever they may be.
I spend most of my days chasing quick dopamine, hanging out with people I find interesting, trying new hobbies and just living life in the now. Right now I really enjoy volleyball, bouldering, and pickleball because of how active each sport is. Currently having a identity crisis because I left school about a year ago and lost my job about a month ago. During this time I have been trying everything that I enjoy but still cannot find what I am REALLY passionate about... I guess I'm still figuring things out but, the journey of finding myself is long from over. I am addicted to certain substances but I recogonize that I am addicted to them. I don't know where my life will go in the next 5 years but I can't wait to see who I will become. But atlast, I am just a spec of sand in a sea full of specs of sand in an never ending sandbox. Someday I want to look at our little spec in the vastness of space in awe.
